EE258 SJSU project-1 Analysis of CIFAR-10 dataset


In this project I developed 3 NN models to classify CIFAR-10 data set. I itereatively increased the performance of the models by changing the hyperparameters.
The first model uses RGB images directly. The second model converts the images to grey scale to train the model. Model 1 and 2 are fully connected feed forward neural networks.
Finally the model 3 is a CNN which uses the RGB images. This project documents the iterations we made on each model to increase its accuracy.s
